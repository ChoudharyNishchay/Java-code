Stored Programs
==================
Stored Program in database is required for
   1. Performing calculation based on given input and return the result (Functions)
   2. Perfom series of SQL statement based on certain inputs and conditions (Procedures)
   3. Perform additional task on execution of DML statements. (Triggers)
   
Why do we need programming in database
1. To bundle several SQL statements together : Can be called by Application server and help reducing network load.
2. Centralized business logic
3. Hide complexity and implementation details (encapsulation)
   
Generic Program in any programming language will have following options / sections

1. Declaration section : Commonly used to declare variables to hold the values during the execution of program.
						 In database we use this area to declare
						 - variables
						 - user defined exceptions
						 - cursors
						 
	Variables
	 
	Declaration format ==> DECLARE variable_name datatype(size) [DEFAULT default_value];
	                eg:    DECLARE lv_ename VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT NULL;
					       DECLARE ln_sal   INTEGER;
						   DECLARE ln_comm,ln_deptno INTEGER DEFAULT NULL;
					
    Assigning values to variable 
						   DURING declaration eg:      DECLARE ln_sal INT DEFAULT 0;
						   During execution            SET ln_sal = 0;
						   USING Select query          SELECT max(sal) INTO ln_sal FROM emp;
						   
						   Note: If using select query to fetch the data into variable we must ensure that select query must give only one row value.
					
	
2. Code execution : Like any other programming language this section is going to have following
		SQL Commands
		Conditional Constructs
		Loops
                
3. Exception Handling section : Exception is defined as run time errors which a program may encounter. We cannot always avert the run time errors
but provide a treatment(solution), just in case it is encountered.

It is an optional coding section which is used to trap run time errors hence


MySQL Program and delimiter
================================
Client tools like workbench and mysql shell (command prompt) consider ';' as command terminator. Hence they start compiling and executing the command as it is encountered.

However a stored program require aggregation of multiple sql statement and other program constructs together hence involve several occurences of command terminator ';'.

eg: 
delimiter //
create procedure p1()
begin
select * from emp;

select * from dept;
end//
